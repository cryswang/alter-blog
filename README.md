# alterBlog
A continuation of the my-first-blog repo. Project for University of Birmginham (UK) School of Computer Science.

This project was to create an interactive blog that would allow users to login and make posts and create a CV page. Additionally, it was designed around testing, and thus comprehensive tests have been written to test user flow and each component. The website can be accessed publicly at: http://cryswang.pythonanywhere.com/
